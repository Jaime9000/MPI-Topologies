# MPI-Topologies

Message passing using MPI:


This lab consisted of implementing a series of parallel programming tasks using the MPI
message passing API on the TACC Stampede cluster. Each task was implemented as a standalone
program written in the C programming language.


Execution:


Implemented the standard message passing in ring and 'ping-pong' format. Also implemented a 'barrier' MPI structure both in ring and tree format.
